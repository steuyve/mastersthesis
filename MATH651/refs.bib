	abstract = {Magnitude is an isometric invariant of metric spaces inspired by category theory. Recent work has shown that the asymptotic behavior under rescaling of the magnitude of subsets of Euclidean space is closely related to intrinsic volumes. Here we prove an upper bound for the magnitude of a convex body in Euclidean space in terms of its intrinsic volumes. The result is deduced from an analogous known result for magnitude in \${\textbackslash}ell\_1{\textasciicircum}N\$, via approximate embeddings of Euclidean space into high-dimensional \${\textbackslash}ell\_1{\textasciicircum}N\$ spaces. As a consequence, we deduce a sufficient condition for infinite-dimensional subsets of a Hilbert space to have finite magnitude. The upper bound is also shown to be sharp to first order for an odd-dimensional Euclidean ball shrinking to a point; this complements recent work investigating the asymptotics of magnitude for large dilatations of sets in Euclidean space.},

	title = {The magnitude of metric spaces},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5857},
	abstract = {Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces, analogous to the Euler characteristic of topological spaces and the cardinality of sets. The definition of magnitude is a special case of a general categorical definition that clarifies the analogies between various cardinality-like invariants in mathematics. Although this motivation is a world away from geometric measure, magnitude, when applied to subsets of R{\textasciicircum}n, turns out to be intimately related to invariants such as volume, surface area, perimeter and dimension. We describe several aspects of this relationship, providing evidence for a conjecture (first stated in {arXiv}:0908.1582) that magnitude subsumes all the most important invariants of classical integral geometry.},

	title = {The magnitude of odd balls via Hankel determinants of reverse Bessel polynomials},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03227},
	abstract = {Magnitude is an invariant of metric spaces with origins in enriched category theory. Using potential theoretic methods, Barcel{\textbackslash}'o and Carbery gave an algorithm for calculating the magnitude of any odd dimensional ball in Euclidean space, and they proved that it was a rational function of the radius of the ball. In this paper an explicit formula is given for the magnitude of each odd dimensional ball in terms of a ratio of Hankel determinants of reverse Bessel polynomials. This is done by finding a distribution on the ball which solves the weight equations. Using Schr{\textbackslash}"oder paths and a continued fraction expansion for the generating function of the reverse Bessel polynomials, combinatorial formulae are given for the numerator and denominator of the magnitude of each odd dimensional ball. These formulae are then used to prove facts about the magnitude such as its asymptotic behaviour as the radius of the ball grows.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02502},
	abstract = {The notion of the magnitude of a metric space was introduced by Leinster in [8] and developed in [10], [9], [11] and [16], but the magnitudes of familiar sets in Euclidean space are only understood in relatively few cases. In this paper we study the magnitudes of compact sets in Euclidean spaces. We first describe the asymptotics of the magnitude of such sets in both the small and large-scale regimes. We then consider the magnitudes of compact convex sets with nonempty interior in Euclidean spaces of odd dimension, and relate them to the boundary behaviour of solutions to certain naturally associated higher order elliptic boundary value problems in exterior domains. We carry out calculations leading to an algorithm for explicit evaluation of the magnitudes of balls, and this establishes the convex magnitude conjecture of Leinster and Willerton [9] in the special case of balls in dimension three. In general we show that the magnitude of an odd-dimensional ball is a rational function of its radius. In addition to Fourier-analytic and {PDE} techniques, the arguments also involve some combinatorial considerations.},
